When you’re learning how to fly fish, it’s best to begin by understanding fly casting basics like your equipment needs. To start learning how to fly fish, you need a fly rod, reel, weighted line and some artificial flies. Flies are made using fly tying techniques that combine thread, wire, beads, feathers, yarn and hair to create artificial insects and bait fish at various stages of maturity to attract trout, salmon, pan fish and carp, as well as marine species such as tarpon, bone fish and striped bass. When learning how to fly fish, remember that this method of fishing uses techniques that are more challenging than other types of fishing. The important thing to know when mastering fly fishing for beginners is that it involves casting a very light-weight fly instead of a heavier lure or natural bait.As you set out to learn how to fly fish, you’ll want to look for an ideal location. Most people think of fly fishing as a sport best enjoyed in mountain streams. Though these types of waters are great places to fly fish, you can also enjoy amazing fishing in the warm waters of ponds and lakes, and in salt water - and catch a broad array of fish. There's probably a body of water you can use for fly fishing not too far from where you live, especially if you are just learning how to fish. - https://www.takemefishing.org/how-to-fish/types-of-fishing/fly-fishing/", img_url: "", createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},

    {userId: 2, topicId: 4, title: "You wouldn't believe what these flowers looked like after they froze", content: "Freezing temperatures can cause brown, crispy growth on plants that are susceptible to frost damage. Frost damage can occur when temperatures dip to or below the freezing point, 32 degrees Fahrenheit (0 degrees Celsius). And both cold-hardy plants and tenderer plants that do best in warmer temperatures can, depending on the circumstances, be affected by frost damage.Growth damaged by frost can look ugly, and your first impulse may be to prune it — but don’t. Believe it or not, you can do more damage if you remove the damaged growth too soon. In fact, those ugly brown leaves actually help to protect the interior of the plant from future freezes. So, let’s dive into frost damage — how it affects our plants and, more important, how and when to prune frost-damaged growth. - https://www.houzz.com/magazine/got-frost-damaged-plants-how-it-happens-and-when-and-how-to-prune-stsetivw-vs~40548361", img_url: "", createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},

The longer you cook Elk, the more likely it is to become dry. This is the cardinal rule.Elk should be cooked to no more than 130-140 degrees Fahrenheit of internal temperature. At 150 degrees the meat starts to dry out because of its lack of fat. The use of a meat thermometer is the best way to determine when the meat has reached the desired degree of doneness. Let the meat rest in the juices, covered for 10-15 minutes before serving.Frying/Browning should be done very quickly - do not overcook! Again, let it rest, covered, before serving.When broiling and grilling, you should cook to no more than rare, or at least medium rare. When you need to serve to someone who prefers meat well-done, marinating the meat in your favorite sauce will help keep the meat deliciously tender. Adding moisture when grilling quality venison is not necessary. However you may wish to spread a small amount of butter or cooking oil onto the meat prior to cooking. After broiling or grilling, let the meat stand for about 8 minutes before serving so that the flavorful juices can accumulate.Use tongs when turning or picking up elk meat. A fork will pierce the meat and cause some of the flavorful juices to escape during cooking.If you need to cut the steak into strips before cooking, first cut against the grain into thin slices. Then stack the slices and cut them into quarter-inch thick strips. Cutting is easier if the steak is slightly frozen.High quality young farm-raised Elk does not need to be marinated to change the texture or to mask the flavor. However a light marinate does help to keep the meat moist and enhances the flavor. Farm-raised Elk is tender and does not have any wild taste. http://www.montanaelk.com/cooking_tips.html", img_url: "", createdAt: new Date(), updatedAt: new Date()},
